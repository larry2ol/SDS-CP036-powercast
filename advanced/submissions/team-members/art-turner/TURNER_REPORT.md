## 🛠️ Week 2: Feature Engineering & Deep Learning Preparation

### 🔄 1. Sequence Construction & Lookback Windows

Q: How did you determine the optimal lookback window size for your sequence models?  
A: Selected 36 timesteps (6 hours) based on several key factors:

  **Technical Analysis:**
  - Lag effect analysis from Week 1 showed 3-6 hour dependencies were most significant
  - Building thermal mass effects require 6-hour window to capture full response cycles
  - Diurnal patterns need sufficient history to detect daily cycles

  **Practical Considerations:**
  - 6 hours captures complete HVAC response cycles
  - Balances memory requirements vs. temporal context
  - Aligns with operational decision-making timescales for energy management
  - Provides sufficient history without excessive computational overhead

  **Validation:**
  - Tested multiple window sizes (12, 24, 36, 48 timesteps)
  - 36 timesteps provided optimal balance of context and computational efficiency
  - Shorter windows missed important temporal dependencies
  - Longer windows showed diminishing returns with increased computational cost

Q: What challenges did you face when converting the time-series data into input/output sequences?  
A: **Critical Target Normalization Issue (Major Challenge):**
  
  Initially encountered catastrophic model performance with negative R² scores (-0.9 to -2.0) across all neural networks, while simple baselines achieved positive R² > 0.7.

  **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Target variables (power consumption) were not properly normalized
  - Models trained on raw target values (0-80,000 kW range) while features were standardized
  - Created massive scale mismatch between inputs and outputs
  - Neural networks couldn't learn meaningful patterns due to gradient scaling issues

  **Solution Implementation:**
  - Added target normalization using MinMaxScaler for power consumption values
  - Implemented proper denormalization in evaluation pipeline for meaningful metrics
  - Created "FIXED" versions of all preprocessing scripts with target scaling
  - Result: Dramatic improvement from negative R² to 99%+ accuracy (R² = 0.9929-0.9941)

  **Other Technical Challenges:**
  - Ensuring proper temporal alignment between sequences and targets
  - Managing memory efficiently for large sequence datasets (52K+ samples)
  - Maintaining chronological order during data splitting

Q: How did you handle cases where the lookback window extended beyond the available data?  
A: **Sequential Windowing Strategy:**

  **Problem:** With 36-timestep lookback windows, first 35 records cannot form complete sequences.

  **Solution Implemented:**
  - Start sequence creation from index 36 onward to ensure all sequences have full historical context
  - Lost first 35 samples (0.07% of dataset) - negligible impact on 52K+ total samples
  - No padding or interpolation used to maintain data integrity
  - Preserved temporal continuity rather than artificially extending data

  **Alternative Approaches Considered:**
  - Zero-padding: Rejected due to artificial data injection
  - Forward-fill: Rejected as it creates unrealistic patterns
  - Shorter initial windows: Rejected to maintain consistent model input dimensions

  **Validation:**
  - Confirmed all generated sequences have exact 36-timestep length
  - Verified no missing or truncated sequences in final dataset
  - Maintained strict temporal ordering throughout entire pipeline

### ⚖️ 2. Feature Scaling & Transformation

Q: Which normalization or standardization techniques did you apply to the features, and why?  
A: **Dual Scaling Strategy:**

  **Features (Environmental & Temporal):**
  - **StandardScaler (Z-score normalization)**: Applied to all input features
  - Rationale: Environmental variables have different units (°C, %, m/s, W/m²)
  - Transforms to mean=0, std=1 for consistent neural network input scaling
  - Preserves relative relationships while normalizing magnitudes

  **Targets (Power Consumption):**
  - **MinMaxScaler (0-1 normalization)**: Applied to all three zones
  - Rationale: Power values have large ranges (0-80,000 kW) that overwhelm neural networks
  - Range [0,1] ensures stable gradients and convergence
  - Easier denormalization for meaningful metric interpretation

  **Why Different Scalers:**
  - StandardScaler: Better for normally-distributed environmental features
  - MinMaxScaler: Better for bounded target variables with known ranges
  - Prevents gradient explosion from large target values
  - Maintains interpretability when denormalizing predictions

Q: Did you engineer any cyclical time features (e.g., sine/cosine transforms for hour or day)? How did these impact model performance?  
A: **Comprehensive Cyclical Feature Engineering:**

  **Features Created:**
  - **Hourly Cycles**: sin/cos transforms for hour (0-23) to capture diurnal patterns
  - **Daily Cycles**: sin/cos transforms for day of week (0-6) for weekly patterns
  - **Monthly Cycles**: sin/cos transforms for month (1-12) for seasonal patterns
  - **Weekend Indicator**: Binary feature for weekend vs. weekday classification

  **Mathematical Implementation:**
  ```python
  hour_sin = sin(2π × hour / 24)
  hour_cos = cos(2π × hour / 24)
  day_sin = sin(2π × day_of_week / 7)
  day_cos = cos(2π × day_of_week / 7)
  ```

  **Performance Impact:**
  - **Critical for capturing periodicity**: Neural networks struggle with raw temporal numbers
  - **Improved convergence**: Models learned temporal patterns more efficiently
  - **Better generalization**: Smooth cyclical features vs. discrete time indices
  - **Preserved continuity**: Hour 23 → Hour 0 transition handled naturally

  **Validation:**
  - Compared models with/without cyclical features
  - Cyclical features essential for achieving 99%+ accuracy
  - Raw hour/day features led to poor temporal pattern recognition

Q: How did you address potential data leakage during scaling or transformation?  
A: **Strict Temporal Data Leakage Prevention:**

  **Critical Implementation:**
  1. **Fit scalers on training data only**: Never exposed scalers to validation/test data
  2. **Transform in sequence**: Train → fit_transform(), Val/Test → transform()
  3. **Temporal split first**: Split data chronologically BEFORE any scaling operations
  4. **Save fitted scalers**: Preserved training scalers for consistent evaluation

  **Specific Measures:**
  ```python
  # Correct approach
  feature_scaler.fit(X_train)  # Only training data
  X_train_scaled = feature_scaler.transform(X_train)
  X_val_scaled = feature_scaler.transform(X_val)    # Same scaler
  X_test_scaled = feature_scaler.transform(X_test)  # Same scaler
  ```

  **What We Prevented:**
  - **Future information leakage**: Test data statistics never influenced training scalers
  - **Validation contamination**: Validation data excluded from scaler fitting
  - **Target leakage**: Target scalers fitted only on training targets
  - **Temporal violations**: Maintained strict chronological boundaries

  **Verification:**
  - Confirmed scaler parameters derived only from training period
  - Validated consistent transformation across all splits
  - Ensured realistic deployment scenario simulation

  - Validation: 15% (Sep 13 - Oct 28, 2017) 
  - Test: 15% (Oct 29 - Dec 30, 2017)

  **Temporal Integrity Measures:**
  - **No shuffling**: Maintained strict chronological order
  - **Sequential splits**: Later time periods never used to predict earlier ones
  - **Gap prevention**: No temporal gaps between consecutive samples within splits
  - **Future isolation**: Test data represents true future unseen scenarios

  **Implementation:**
  ```python
  n_samples = len(sequences)
  train_end = int(0.7 * n_samples)
  val_end = int(0.85 * n_samples)
  
  train_seq = sequences[:train_end]
  val_seq = sequences[train_end:val_end]
  test_seq = sequences[val_end:]
  ```

Q: What considerations did you make to prevent information leakage between splits?  
A: **Multi-Layer Leakage Prevention:**

  - No cross-split sequence contamination

Q: How did you format your data for use with PyTorch DataLoader or TensorFlow tf.data.Dataset?  
A: **PyTorch DataLoader Implementation:**

  **Custom Dataset Class:**
  ```python
  class PowerConsumptionDataset(Dataset):
      def __init__(self, sequences, targets):
          self.sequences = torch.FloatTensor(sequences)
          self.targets = torch.FloatTensor(targets)
      
      def __getitem__(self, idx):
          return self.sequences[idx], self.targets[idx]
  ```

  **DataLoader Configuration:**
  - **Batch size**: 64 (balanced memory vs. gradient stability)

### 📈 4. Feature-Target Alignment

Q: How did you align your input features and target variables for sequence-to-one or sequence-to-sequence forecasting?  
A: **Sequence-to-One Forecasting Architecture:**

  **Alignment Strategy:**
  - **Input**: 36 timesteps of features (environmental + temporal)
  - **Target**: Single timestep prediction for next period across 3 zones
  - **Prediction horizon**: 10 minutes ahead (next measurement)

  **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Input sequence: features at times t-35, t-34, ..., t-1, t
  # Target: power consumption at time t+1
  X = sequences[i:i+36, :]    # 36 historical timesteps
  y = targets[i+36, :]        # Next timestep prediction
  ```

  **Rationale:**
  - Simulates real-world forecasting: predict next period based on history
  - Manageable complexity for baseline models
  - Clear evaluation framework with single-step accuracy metrics

Q: Did you encounter any issues with misalignment or shifting of targets? How did you resolve them?  
A: **Target Alignment Verification:**

  **Potential Issues Identified:**
  - Off-by-one errors in sequence indexing
  - Temporal misalignment between features and targets
  - Inconsistent prediction horizons across samples

  **Resolution Methods:**
  1. **Index Validation**: Carefully verified sequence[i:i+36] → target[i+36] alignment
  2. **Timestamp Checking**: Confirmed temporal consistency in generated sequences

  **Gradient Clipping (Max Norm: 1.0):**
  - **Purpose**: Prevent gradient explosion in recurrent networks
  - **Critical for stability**: Essential for LSTM/GRU training
  - **Impact**: Eliminated training instabilities

  **Learning Rate Scheduling:**
  - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Factor 0.7, patience 7 epochs
  - **Adaptive reduction**: When validation loss plateaus
  - **Effect**: Fine-tuned convergence, avoided local minima

  **Early Stopping (Patience: 15):**
  - **Validation-based**: Monitored validation loss
  - **Prevented overfitting**: Stopped before performance degradation
  - **Result**: Optimal model checkpoints without manual tuning

Q: What challenges did you encounter during training (e.g., overfitting, vanishing gradients), and how did you address them?  
A: **Major Challenge: Target Normalization Crisis**

  **The Problem:**
  - Initial models achieved negative R² scores (-0.9 to -2.0)
  - All neural networks failed while simple baselines succeeded
  - Weeks of troubleshooting revealed target scaling issue

  **Root Cause:**
  - Features normalized (StandardScaler) but targets left raw (0-80,000 kW)
  - Massive scale mismatch caused gradient optimization failure
  - Neural networks couldn't learn meaningful patterns

  **Solution:**
  - Implemented target normalization using MinMaxScaler
  - Added proper denormalization in evaluation pipeline
  - Created "FIXED" versions of all preprocessing scripts

  **Other Challenges Addressed:**
  - **Gradient explosion**: Solved with gradient clipping
  - **Overfitting**: Managed with dropout and early stopping
  - **Slow convergence**: Improved with learning rate scheduling

  **Result:**
  - Dramatic improvement from negative R² to 99%+ accuracy
  - All three architectures achieved excellent performance (R² > 0.99)
